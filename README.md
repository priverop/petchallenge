# Pet Challenge

The goal of this project is to develop a web app to find your perfect pet.

This project is being managed [here](https://trello.com/b/mT7EpOG9/pet-challenge).

**Note to myself! Use [this](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate-cra-template) for the next project.**

## Features

- Retreive pet profiles.
- Show a full profile.
- Mark "like" on profiles.
- 2 screens, minimum 3 profiles with: photo, name, description.
- Cool transitions! Fade in on load, carousels, etc.

### Scaling the app

- Instaling SCSS + JS preprocessors.
- Split vars.scss into multiples files (colors, images, etc).


## Stack

- ReactJS
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase functions using NodeJS

### Extra Libraries
- ESLint with Aribnb ruleset.
- Prettier.
- StyleLint.

* I won't install EditorConfig because I'm the only contributor.

#### Configuration

- ESLint disabled ['react/react-in-jsx-scope'](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/react-in-jsx-scope.md) as we define global React var in `index.jsx` and ['jsx-filename-extension'](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-filename-extension.md).
- [Why I am using `.js` instead of `.jsx`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/87#issuecomment-234627904). [More discussion](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/985#issuecomment-239145468).
